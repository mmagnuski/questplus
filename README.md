# questplus
A test implementation of quest plus in python.  
This implementation is not well tested and not feature-complete, so I reccomend using
Richard HÃ¶chenberger's `questplus` package (https://github.com/hoechenberger/questplus).
Quest plus is also available in psychopy - see the docs for `psychopy.data.QuestPlusHandler` (psychopy uses Richard's questplus package).
